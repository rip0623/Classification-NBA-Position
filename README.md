# Classification-NBA-Position
Gathered data from draft combine and from a dataset of all seasonal player data for players from 1950. Combined both datasets to look 
at players drafted between 2010 and 2017. Identified various attributes that would be important to accurately predict player position
(looked at both combined dataset and each dataset individually). 
For each scenario, I graphed an accuracy plot with the value of K being on the x-axis (for both trained and testing data). 
Ended off with final model.
